The Validator 0x677B24C03686b98ecFa5fd45e07b65c184c56D3C has been inactive for over a month but continues to be in the Active Validator list. Attempts to reach the Validator via Discord has so far failed. As a permissionless system, the Validator is primarily responsible for watching over the service. The continuity on the Active Validator list while being actually inactive is unhealthy for the system technically and reputation-wise and therefore needs to be delisted. There seems to be no other way to do this than to apply a 100% slashing which is constitutional at this level of failure. Only the self stake which amounts to 3,608.6Q will be affected by the slashing; the delegated stakes will not be affected.
